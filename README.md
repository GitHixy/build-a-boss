# Build a Boss

BaB is a fantasy browser PvE game where you create, train, and evolve your own boss monster. Program its patterns, skills, and taunts, then challenge the community to defeat it! The more your boss wins, the higher it climbs in the rankings. After each defeat, evolve and improve your creation to become the ultimate challenge.

## 🎮 Game Concept
- **Create your Boss:** Design your own fantasy boss, choose its appearance, skills, and AI behavior.
- **Train & Evolve:** After each defeat, analyze the battle and improve your boss to make it even harder to beat.
- **Challenge the Community:** Other players will try to defeat your boss. The more victories, the higher your boss will rank.
- **Asynchronous PvE:** Battles are simulated; you can play, improve, and challenge at your own pace.

## ✨ Technologies Used (Frontend)
- **React** (JavaScript)
- **Vite** (for fast development and build)
- **React Router** (SPA navigation)
- **react-icons** (iconography)
- **Custom CSS** (no frameworks)
- **Google Fonts:** Cinzel

```
